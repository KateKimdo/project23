						<h2>Microsite - Designer, Developer</h2>
						<p>With the direction from my Creative director, Laura Weil, I was able to create a website with the topic of Newtro. I have never knew what Newtro was until I was given with this topic even though I am Korean, which was a great experience of getting to know my culture even more. It was quite a struggle creating navigation bar and different html pages for the first time, but I am proud of how it came through and I had so much fun with it.</p>

						<h2>Nutrition Information Portal - Designer, Developer</h2>
						<p>For this project, I created an interactive nutrition information platform using React, which allows users to search for the nutritional content of foods by typing in a search bar. Through the integration of the FoodData Central API, nutritional data is retrieved dynamically based on user input. The project combines custom HTML and CSS for structure and design, while the interactivity is driven by JavaScript and AJAX calls. By implementing a responsive design, I ensured that the site functions smoothly across different devices, and all the content and interactions are updated efficiently through React's state management system.</p>

					<h2>Recipe Page</h2>
					<p>I designed a recipe page in creating a Dalgona candy, which became famous after being on the show, Squid Game. This is a personal favorite candy that contains so many memories of when I was young, buying this candy everyday after school. This was my first time creating a website out of scratch, which was both an interesting and great learning experience. I am very happy with how it turned out with just basic information but with responsive elements that can be viewed on my phone screen.</p>
